# Keystroke-Pattern-Recognition

Biometric features can be broadly classified into two categories: physiological and behavioral, as illustrated in Fig 1. Physiological features include characteristics that
are related to the individual’s physical body, such as fingerprints, facial features, iris
patterns, and DNA. Behavioral features include characteristics that are related to the
individual’s behavior, such as their signature, voice, and typing rhythm.
Our project falls into the last category listed under behavioural biometrics feautures,
Keystroke Dynamics.

Our aim in this research is to explore the possibility of Identifying and Verifying
computer users by extracting and analyzing their keyboard typing patterns. We study
the performances of four novel architectures based on Na¨ıve Bayes and the L2 Norm
metric, both modeled to solve identification and verification tasks. In order to do
this, we explore a variety of data collection techniques and show how a mixture of the
considered ones leads to optimized results. We then evaluate all the resulting models by
computing the most commonly used metrics for each task, and comparing them with
those achieved by Giot, El-Abed and Rosenberger in [1]. Although our database is
autonomously made, and therefore not as rich of information as those used by state of
the art models, results point towards the conclusion that Keystroke Pattern Recognition
is a fairly precise way to tell individuals apart.
